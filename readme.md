## Note

For several reasons (including exams and lack of time management), my game didn't come out very polished.

This is [very much a prototype](https://github.com/shreyasminocha/WiFiHunt/issues). I never got to fully test the game so it might be unbeatable, it might be too easy. I don't even know. I made way too many compromises to meet the deadline. Not proud of the result. But then this was my first time making a game or even working with HTML5 Canvas. I definitely learn a hell lot.

I'll probably work on fixing bugs and improving the game even though the competition is already over.

I've written [a blog post](https://shreyasminocha.me/blog/js13k-2018-postmortem) about my journey this year and the lessons I learnt.
